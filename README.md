# Moogle

A simple sample application for learning React. This is a music search engine that uses the discogs.com API to search artists, albums,
or songs by name.

## Running the Application

You will need to get a personal access token at discogs.com and insert it into the code in src/js/components/functional/SearchPage.js
where you see the text "[[YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN]]".

To get a token, create an account at https://www.discogs.com, then go to Settings > Developers > Generate Token.
